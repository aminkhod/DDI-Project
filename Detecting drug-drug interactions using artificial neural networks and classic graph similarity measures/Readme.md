# Drug-drug interaction detection, AMF & AMFP.

This repository contains code necessary for preprocessing, training and evaluating drug-drug interaction detection systems. In particular AMF and AMFP are implemented here. 
The method was published lately in PLOS One:
Shtar G, Rokach L, Shapira B (2019) Detecting drug-drug interactions using artificial neural networks and classic graph similarity measures. PLOS ONE 14(8): e0219796. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219796

Drug-drug interactions are preventable causes of medical injuries and often result in1doctor and emergency room visits.  Computational techniques can be used to predict2potential drug-drug interactions.  We approach the drug-drug interaction prediction problem as a link prediction problem and present two novel methods for drug-drug interaction prediction based on artificial neural networks and factor propagation over graph nodes:  adjacency matrix factorization (AMF) and adjacency matrix factorization6with propagation (AMFP).

## Data:

The data should be downloaded from [DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca/) and placed under `pickles\data\DrugBank_releases\version`. for example, the file containing version 5.0.0 should be placed under: 
`pickles\data\DrugBank_releases\5.0.0\drugbank_all_full_database.xml.zip`

## Running the code:

use Main.py or DDI.ipyn. Tested on Python 3.6.

Results are written to Results folder. In particular figures containing the metrics used in the paper given above and the embeddings created for each drug. The predictions are printed to the screen with the final results. Note: the last entry for each drug embedding contains the Bias value for this drug.
