# Legal Prerequisites to DrugBank Reuse

The DrugBank version 4.5 release on April 19, 2016 brought a major update to its terms and licensing. Downloading DrugBank now requires registration. Registration requires entering into the [following agreement](http://www.drugbank.ca/public_users/sign_up "Sign up for DrugBank account"):

> **I accept DrugBank's Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and the above End User License Agreement (required)**

> By checking the above box, you are confirming that your use of DrugBank shall not be for commercial purposes. If you wish to use DrugBank for commercial purposes, contact info@omx.io to inquire about a separate agreement with OMx.

This directory contains the aforementioned texts (retrieved on 2015-05-08):

+ Privacy Policy ([`privacy.md`](privacy.md))
+ Terms of Use ([`terms.md`](terms.md))
+ Standard Non-Commercial End User License Agreement ([`EULA.md`](EULA.md))

Note that this repository (`dhimmel/drugbank`) is built using DrugBank 4.2 which at time of download had no registration and a [brief license](https://github.com/dhimmel/integrate/blob/7b95bf337d6e43e54457621f39a7341e620138f7/licenses/custom/DrugBank.md "DrugBank licensing statement from 2015-08-20"). Hence, the `legal` directory is relevant only for future DrugBank downloads.
